  <blockquote>
  <p>The one who lits the souls of whole Country by blowing of theirs 
The unknown Confidence,but full Concern 
The only,who never Holocaust the hopes of dependants 
The one who always desires a Country to be applauded by others 
The way of incuring their ardor towards Motherland,where every joins hand to hoist the furl of Tricolor in Air,saluting with head held high in arrogance, singing Anthem with the tone of Success shows the patriotism towards Country.
Standing like a hailstorm in war,full of fierce to combat envy
Every forward step they were,losing hopes on lives  
This Audacity puts the Motherland Peace today!!! 
The One who never cedes up at any moment and always stands like shadow in darkness 
Walking across the snow,living in moonlight,surviving with basic rudiments, celebrations in campfires,ending up years together in Single Uniform with the missile all the time 
Leaving the rest to happen best,moving to the warfield giving the promise will be back,but with the flag in hand or wrapped in it!!!!
Yet in stage of defeating never let's the Vose of Nation Drop-down 
The guts to accept the challenge of defenders prior to Nation
Losing of lives,shattering the hopes of awaiting belongings breaking bonds uttering the word "JAI HIND"inhailing the last breath of Patriotism will surely lay a way to Heaven.
A Sacrifice where no one dares to do!!

<div class="panel"><blockquote><p>Alarming Sunshine  wakes you up from East with  dozy MoonLight setting in the west,,,, pushes you to alluring weather to view radiant Morning rays n hear ebb of shores  and ending up the day with Twilight Sunset wishing you a happy day!!

The Gloomy Autumn 
The Spring Spree
The Firy Summer 
The Stormy Rainy
The Icy Winter,if make up seasons, Then this would be a perfect Location to check in,,,, Guess what it would be??? 

Here's a hint:
The Essence of cool breeze from Peaks of North,The vibes from West, The iconic Sculptures from East,The Flavor of Monuments from South make up a well honorable Place to be applauded.

It's ineffable to bewray a nations Greatness in a single post!!! 
But my curiosity made me hold the pen!!! 
A country which is Renowned,which is valiant,which is indescribable n perfect example for other nations  to stand first as  preferable choice in all standards 

Impeccable Nation, Tricolor Flag, Meaningful Cognizance,incredible improvises, unbelievable Knowledge,Numerous Races and no.of.Cultures

How blissful we are to reside in a Country which is abundant with Multiple Credits,where a ruler is chosen by people's priority.
It is a place where the power of this sand is appreciated worldwide for its Uncountable achievements.
Where the intention of innocence comes with in one's soul, where the origin of several holy Rivers took place,A country where freedom Is synonymed as right,where great people are born n brought up as Leaders
A place where people uniten not only for sharing happiness but stands by conflict times too.... Giving hopes for future 
An example to show where humanity is still alive!!
Happy that not that other countries developed,but every country is indeed of an INDIAN, 
What a great nation!!which is among Wonders of World,
Old Is gold,Those monuments left,where taken as one of the wonders ,unbelievable facts which in turn reflects by adding as Universal Truth 
Though era changes Epics lasts,,by giving message to every generation 
How lucky that the origin of Epics have also chosen this Country!!! 

People are strength of Nation 
Leaders monitor the Nation
Epics add History to Nation 
Monuments multiply beauty of Nation
Rights gives Confidence to Nation
Students are back bone of Nation
but
ARMY is Breath of Nation  
Realise that we are today here only because of their sacrifices made..

Now feel proud for our beloved,bestowed Country
